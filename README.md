I've always thought that it'd be cool if early in the morning, rather than going through 15 apps to see what I missed during my sleep, instead, I could just have one interface/dashboard that tells me everything about that happened while I was away.

I also thought that this project would be a very good demonstration of the usefulness of state-management libraries, and the skills I've gained through trying to work with them when I was making Roblox games. (Thank you, Roblox TypeScript & Charm)

## On the Works:

- 🔢 Integration with database (thinking postgreSQL) to cache a few days back, for even more "Overseering"
- 🎵 Discord Bot(?)
- 🍎 Mobile App
