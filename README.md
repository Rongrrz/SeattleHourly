I've always thought that it'd be cool if early in the morning, rather than going through 15 apps to see what I missed during my sleep, instead, I could just have one interface/dashboard that tells me everything about that happened while I was away.

I also thought that this project would be a very good demonstration of the usefulness of state-management libraries, and the skills I've gained through trying to work with them when I was making Roblox games. (Thank you, Roblox TypeScript & Charm)
